This is a personal Portfolio Site I have created using Next.js, Typescript, and Tailwind.CSS. This sight has a light and dark mode sensitive to the settings of your browser. If you would like to use it as a jumping off point for creating your own vision, I encourage you to check the documentation on the tech stack and have fun!

## Getting Started

This project uses Yarn. If you do not currently have it installed, you will need to do so.

After making sure yarn is installed and cloning the repo, in your terminal run:
```bash 
yarn install
```

Once all dependencies are installed and you want to start development run ```yarn dev```
This will start hot reloads and start running your server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If you plan to use this project as a jumping off point note that there are two main sections you will be doing a majority of your work. These two places will be ***components*** and ***pages***. If you want to change out the layout of your page to reference specific components on each page you will have to edit the layout section of your **index** page.
