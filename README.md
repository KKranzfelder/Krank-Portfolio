This is a personal Portfolio Site I have created using Next.js, Typescript, and Tailwind.CSS. If you would like to use it as a jumping off point for creating your own vision, I encourage you to check the documentation on the tech stack and have fun!

##Getting Started

This project uses Yarn. If you do not currently have it installed, you will need to do so.

After making sure yarn is installed and cloning the repo, in your terminal run ```bash yarn install```

Once all dependencies are installed and you want to start development run ```bash yarn dev```
This will start hot reloads and start running your server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
